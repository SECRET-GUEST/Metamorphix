Metamorphix 🧪 is a miscellaneous collection of scripts I occasionally find myself using. They are pieced together from various scripts and have been managed by a GPT model for coherence. I haven't tested them all, but they should all work as intended.

## Description 📖

This repository is somewhat of a hodgepodge of scripts. Some of them have not been tested but should work. I merged all the scripts using a chat GPT model, but I didn't watch or test what it did... :man_shrugging:	

I created an installer that you can use, but really, I'm just posting this here so I don't forget about the project. The code is a mix of French and English, so good luck and have fun! :laughing:

## Utility

The scripts included in this project cover a range of functionality, such as:

- Removing image backgrounds
- Image resizing
- Converting ARW to JPG
- Pixelating images
- Converting videos to GIFs
- Markdown to HTML conversion
- MP3 to WAV conversion

All of these are accessible through a convenient PyQt5 GUI. Check out the main page of the project to learn more.
